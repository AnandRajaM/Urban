## Features

#### Resource Prediction & Management
Through the power and water quality prediction models, Urban enables cities to predict and manage resources efficiently, ensuring sustainable development and improved quality of life.

#### Citizen Engagement: 
Citizens can raise concerns directly from their dashboard to authorites allowing fast and efficient solutions.

#### Easy and Intuitive Interface
The Urban website provides a simple and seamless user experience  with easy access to dashboard.


## ML Models 

#### Water Quality Prediction
The water quality model in Urban utilizes ph, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes	and Turbidity to predict and assess water quality. By analyzing these parameters, the model provides insights into water safety and potential contamination risks.
Models Used for this are:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest
- XGBoost  
- SVM


#### Energy Prediction 
The power/energy prediction model in Urban uses Facebook Prophet to analyze past energy use patterns. By understanding how energy consumption changes over time—like during different seasons or times of day—the model predicts future energy needs accurately. This helps city planners manage energy efficiently, save costs, and promote sustainability. Ultimately, it ensures reliable energy supply and supports long-term environmental goals for urban areas.
